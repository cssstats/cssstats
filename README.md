# Local Dev

## Global Dependencies

You must have node installed to run cssstats. If you don't have node installed yet
grab it now: [node.js](http://nodejs.org)

## Project Setup

If you have git installed you can clone the repo.

```
git clone git@github.com:cssstats/cssstats.git
cd cssstats
npm install && npm start
```

Note: If you do not have a github account you will need to clone the repo with the https:// url
```
https://github.com/cssstats/cssstats.git
```

You can then open your browser to (http://localhost:3000) to see it running locally

If you want to edit css for your local application you can run
```
npm run css
```
This will regenerate base.min.css which is currently included in the head of the app.

# Running in Docker
Build the image with a name:
```
docker build -t my-cssstats-image .
```

Then run:
```
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 my-cssstats-image
```

Now you can access it on http://localhost:3000 .
